            <p>Dear homo-sapiens, welcome to the first humans’ reactions/acceptance database where you can witness the development of our normal human brain that carries concerns, feelings, behaviors, and skepticism about artificial intelligence and its consequences.</p>
            <p>Here in <strong>Homo Technologicus</strong>, we are interested in the present and the future of artificial intelligence, which has become a significant part of our short life. We are the first platform designed and operated to record human reactions to AI and analyze them over time, taking into account societal changes, economic status, and ethical beliefs. This website is significant.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Dear homo-sapiens, you are most welcome to print your pure neurological feelings with 2 basic simple questions. This Web is mainly about taking a survey from people as a primitive record. All you have to do is to give us 1 to 3 mins from your short life to contribute to this database. The first question is about whether you agree or don’t agree with adding AI supplies to yourself. And the next question is to scale yourself from 0 to 10 for how much fear does this idea “adding AI supplies to yourself” scares you. 0 means no fear at all.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Regardless of my way of talking, this website reminds you that we are more than feelings; we have the brain that was the reason for AI in the first place. It is totally understandable that this quick development causes fear for many of us. We want to remind ourselves here that things need to be understandable so that they become less scary.</p>

            <p>Your submission is like a record for earlier humans’ thoughts and emotions about the AI around us and inside us. The information will be recorded in a database and analyzed, and can be represented in graphic images for the public. There will be some filter tools to sort the country, age, sex, and level of education to witness humans' different reactions across the world. Your submission will contribute to the graph shape and reflection.</p>
